The **Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective (TACC)** has been actively working on issues that relate to the trans community. We’ve published a set of government petitions on the UK parliamentary website, and we’d like your support to make sure these important issues are heard. By signing and sharing these petitions, you’re helping to amplify our voices and push for real change.

## 📜 List of Petitions:

1. ### [Lift on the ban on puberty blockers](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700215)
   *Puberty blockers are reversible treatments that give trans youth time to explore their identity without permanent changes. The current ban was made by Ministers not medical practitioners and is based upon an advisory statement in the Cass Review.*

2. ### [An independent evaluation of the Cass review on child gender services](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700217)
   *The Cass review declined to speak to gender dysphoria specialists due to an apparent bias. Cass declined to name those involved in the review however slowly those who helped write the review have become known. A significant number of participants are from gender critical organisations.*

3. ### [Ensure fair and inclusive participation for trans athletes in sports](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700219)
   *Trans athletes face discrimination and exclusion from sports at various levels. A violation of human rights. Policies often do not reflect the complexities of gender identity and the realities of hormone treatments, leading to unfair bans and restrictions.*

4. ### [Mandate that schools use trans students' chosen names and pronouns.](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700221)
   *Some schools fail to acknowledge the preferred names and pronouns of trans pupils, leading to misgendering, distress, and a lack of acceptance in the educational environment.*
